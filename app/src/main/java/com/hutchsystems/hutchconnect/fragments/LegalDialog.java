Hutch Systems warrants that the Product will operate in substantial conformity with the Documentation, and Hutch Systems will take reasonable commercial efforts to ensure the optimum performance of the Product and reasonable levels of system uptime and availability. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that it uses the Product, and relies on content contained in or resulting from the Product, at the Customer’s sole discretion and risk, that the nature and use of the Product requires the exercise by the Customer of subjective judgments as to accuracy, materiality, relevance and other factors of the data produced, and it is the responsibility of Customer to review, check and confirm results, and it will be solely responsible for any damage to its business, systems or loss of data that may result from the use of the Product. <br><br><strong>8.2 Acknowledgment regarding Internet.</strong> The Customer acknowledges and accepts that, despite the internet being accepted as a secure environment, there may be interruptions in service or events, and access to the Applications may be interrupted, suspended or terminated from time to time, due to circumstances both within and beyond the control of Hutch Systems. Despite Hutch Systems’s reasonable commercial efforts to keep the Applications accessible at all times, the Applications may be unavailable from time to time for any reason, and the Customer acknowledges and agrees that Hutch Systems shall not be responsible at any time for any claims, data lost or damages incurred while transmitting information on the internet with respect to the Applications. While Hutch Systems shall take reasonable precautions to ensure security of the Product and to protect Customer Information, Customer acknowledges that the internet provides the opportunity for unauthorized third parties to gain access to the Applications and Customer Information. Accordingly, Hutch Systems cannot and does not guarantee the privacy or security of any Customer information transferred over or stored in any system connected to the internet, and Hutch Systems disclaims any warranty or representation that confidentiality of information transmitted through the provision of the Product can or will be maintained. The Customer acknowledges that Hutch Systems shall not be liable for any access to or usage by third parties of any information used in connection with the Product, and Hutch Systems’s sole and exclusive liability shall be for Hutch Systems to correct any reported problem in the Applications directly attributable to its own support failure. <br><br><strong>8.3 Limitation of Liability.</strong> Except for the specific limited warranties provided herein, Hutch Systems gives no warranties or conditions (whether implied or arising by statute or otherwise in law, or from a course of dealing or usage of trade) with respect to the Product, and no representation as to accuracy, availability or usability. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, except for the limited warranties specifically provided herein, Hutch Systems hereby disclaims all warranties, conditions or duties of every nature whatsoever, including without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose, that the functions contained in the Applications will meet the Customer’s requirements, or that the operation of the Applications will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error free. Additionally, except for the limited warranties specifically provided herein, Hutch Systems makes no warranty that Product will operate precisely as described or that all errors will be corrected, or that the Applications are free from infection by viruses, bugs or other defects that can impact on the Product. The Customer hereby waives all claims against Hutch Systems for interference, disruption, or incompatibility between the Product and the Systems, and in the event of such interference, disruption, or incompatibility, the Customer’s sole remedy shall be to terminate the Applications as provided herein. Hutch Systems AND ITS AGENTS SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, INJURY, CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT OR OTHERWISE), LIABILITY OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE) FOR ANY CAUSE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL Hutch Systems OR ITS AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LEGAL FEES), WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS, LOST DATA OR ANY FAILURE OF SECURITY RESULTING FROM (I) THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, OR (II) THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT, EVEN IF Hutch Systems HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. The Customer agrees that the Customer’s only recovery for any damages that the Customer may incur, and the Customer’s exclusive remedy, shall be limited to the direct damages the Customer actually incurs up to the maximum aggregate amount of Fees that Hutch Systems received from the Customer during the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date on which the event giving rise to the cause of action is alleged to have occurred, irrespective of the nature of the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of certain warranties or conditions, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to the Customer. No action against either party or any of its Agents, regardless of form (including negligence), arising out of or in any way related to hereto may be brought by the other party more than one year after the cause of action has arisen.<br><br><strong>8.4 Indemnification by Customer.</strong> The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold Hutch Systems, its affiliates, and their respective Agents harmless from and against any and all liabilities, claims, demands, actions, damages, loss, cost or expense, including reasonable legal fees, made by any third party, arising out of any breach of the provisions of these Terms of Service or any other agreement of the parties with respect to the Product by the Customer or its Agents, the use of the Product by the Customer, or arising as a result of any third party alleging that the use of the Product by the Customer or its Agents, other than in accordance with these Terms of Service, infringes, misappropriates or violates any Intellectual Property of the third party. <br><br><strong>8.5 Indemnification by Hutch Systems.</strong> Hutch Systems shall indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against third party claims for infringement or violation of third party intellectual property rights associated with the Product, and may, at its sole option and expense: <br><br>(a) procure for Customer the right to continue using the affected Product; <br>(b) replace the same with a product of similar functions and efficiency that is not subject to such an action; or <br>(c) modify the Product so that there is no longer any infringement or breach, provided that such modification does not adversely affect the functional capabilities as provided in the Documentation; <br><br>provided however that Hutch Systems shall have no liability respecting any claim of infringement or breach to the extent such claim is based upon the combination, operation or use by the Customer of the Applications or Hardware with other equipment, software, apparatus, devices or things not supplied by Hutch Systems or in a manner not substantially consistent with Hutch Systems specifications and Documentation. This section states the entire liability of Hutch Systems for any type of infringement or breach whatsoever of intellectual property rights of third parties resulting from or relating to the provision by Hutch Systems of the Product or Support. <br><br><strong>8.6 Mutual Indemnity Provisions.</strong> Each party’s indemnity obligations hereunder are subject to the following: <br><br>(a) the aggrieved party shall promptly notify the indemnifier in writing of the claim; <br>(b) the indemnifier shall have sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations with respect to the claim; and <br>(c) the aggrieved party shall cooperate fully to the extent necessary, and execute all documents necessary for the defense of such claim.<br><br><strong>9. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong><br><br><strong>9.1 Non-Solicitation/Non-Interference.</strong> The Customer is prohibited from soliciting or hiring any employees, independent contractors or agents of Hutch Systems (either directly or indirectly), without written permission of Hutch Systems, at any time during the any Agreement, and for a period of two (2) years following its termination. The Customer shall not at any time interfere or attempt to interfere with the business of Hutch Systems, or persuade or attempt to persuade any customer or prospective customer of Hutch Systems to discontinue or alter its relationship with Hutch Systems.<br><br><strong>9.2 Dispute Resolution.</strong> In the event of a dispute of the Terms of Service, the parties will use good faith efforts to settle such dispute within thirty days of notice of the dispute being delivered, failing which the dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act (Ontario). The arbitration award shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitrator shall be borne by the unsuccessful party to the arbitration.<br><br><strong>9.3 Force Majeure.</strong> Neither party hereto shall be liable to the other for delay in any performance or for the failure to render any performance of obligations when such delay or failure is a direct result of any present or future statute, law, ordinance, regulation, order, failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers, judgment or decree, act of God, earthquake, epidemic, explosion, lockout, boycott, strike, labor unrest, riot, war, or similar catastrophic occurrence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions shall not be applicable to any obligation involving the payment of money by the Customer. <br><br><strong>9.4 Notices.</strong> Any notice given by one party to the other shall be sufficiently given if (a) personally delivered or couriered, (b) mailed by regular mail, or (c) sent by facsimile or other electronic transmission, and shall be deemed to be received by the recipient on the fifth business day after mailing, if sent by mail, and on the day of delivery if delivered or sent by facsimile. Such notices shall be sent to the parties at the address provided in the relevant Order Form. <br><br><strong>9.5 Jurisdiction.</strong> The Terms of Service and any Order Form shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without reference to conflicts of law principles. The Customer irrevocably attorns to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ontario with respect to any dispute or legal proceeding which may arise out of, under, or in connection with these Terms of Service or any Order Form. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply. Either party must initiate a cause of action for any claim(s) arising out of or relating hereto and its subject matter within one (1) year from the date when such party knew, or should have known after reasonable investigation, of the facts giving rise to the claim(s).<br><br><strong>9.6 Export Control.</strong> The Terms of Service and any agreement between the parties are subject to any governmental laws, orders or other restrictions on the export of software programs and related information and documentation that may be imposed by governmental authorities. The Customer shall comply with any governmental laws, order or other restrictions related to export and re‑export (including technical data and any related information and documentation) which may be imposed from time to time by governments of Canada and the United States and any other applicable country.<br><br><strong>9.7 Assignment.</strong> The Customer may not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations, or any right to access and use the Product, in whole or in part, including without limitation by operation of law, without Hutch Systems's prior written consent. Any attempt to assign without such consent will be null and void, and the Customer agrees to notify Hutch Systems immediately of any change of ownership. Hutch Systems may assign this Agreement and subcontract or delegate its obligations hereunder to any third party without the consent of, but on notice to, the Customer. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement and the terms and conditions will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns.<br><br><strong>9.8 Severability</strong>. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the unenforceable portion shall be construed in accordance with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, or may be severed therefrom, and the remainder of the provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity of that provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.<br><br><strong>9.9 Waiver.</strong> Any waiver of any provisions must be in writing. Failure by either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision, or failure to exercise any right or remedy under the Terms of Service does not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy. <br><br><strong>9.10 Entire Agreement.</strong>&nbsp; These Terms of Service, together with any Order Form and including all exhibits and schedules and any other documents incorporated by reference, including Hutch Systems’s Privacy and Anti-Spam Policy located at http://www.Hutch Systems.com/privacy, collectively constitute the entire agreement and understanding between Hutch Systems and the Customer with respect to the relevant subject matter, and supersedes any and all prior written or verbal agreements, proposals or representations. In the event of an inconsistency between the Terms of Service, any Order Form or Documentation with respect to the subject matter hereof, the order of precedence shall be (1) the Order Form, (2) the Terms of Service, and (3) the Documentation, to the extent necessary to remedy such inconsistency. Headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and will have no legal meaning or effect.<br><br><strong>9.11 Amendment.</strong> No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service or any Order Form will be effective unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties, and neither the course of conduct between Hutch Systems and the Customer, nor any trade practice, shall act to modify any provision thereof. <br><br>9.12 Customer Confirmation. The Customer acknowledges that it has carefully read and understood the Terms of Service, and has been advised to obtain independent legal advice before accepting these Terms of Service, and has either done so, or chosen not to do so.</p>";
